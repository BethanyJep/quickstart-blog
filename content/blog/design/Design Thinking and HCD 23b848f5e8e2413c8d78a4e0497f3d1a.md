Exploring web design, you encounter various frameworks. The top ones that come to mind are Angular, React and Vue. *A framework is a supporting structure for an underlying system or concept.*
<!--more-->

> Frameworks involve - processes, theories, and methods.

Going through university and pursuing an Innovation Degree, I have come across several frameworks and models for innovations. One of the top questions that came to mind when I came across them was how will I apply them in real life? Are they necessary? Let me quote James Clear a bit:

> ðŸ’¡ "If you never copy best practices, youâ€™ll have to repeat all the mistakes yourself.
If you only copy best practices, youâ€™ll always be one step behind the leaders."

# Design Thinking (DT) vs Human Centred Design (HCD)

## Design Thinking

**DT -** a *process* that you go through to create solutions that will be adopted by people - can be used by any company aimed at creating processes

Aim - understand the user, challenge assumptions, and redefine problems.

Helps us develop empathy, question assumptions, brainstorm ideas, prototyping, sketching, and testing out ideas

### Steps 

**Step 1:** - empathise [with your users] â€” involves consulting experts to find out more about the area of concern through *observing, engaging, and empathizing* with people to understand their experiences and motivations, as well as immersing yourself in the physical environment so you can gain a deeper personal understanding of the issues involved.

**Step 2:** - define your usersâ€™ needs, their problem, and your insights â€” You should seek to define the problem as a **problem statement** in a human-centred manner. You can create *personas*

**Step 3:** - ideate [by challenging assumptions and creating ideas for innovative solutions] â€” Ideation techniques such as *Brainstorm, Brain write, Worst Possible Idea, and SCAMPER.* How might we

**Step 4:** - prototype [to start creating solutions] â€” an experimental phase, and the aim is to identify the best possible solution for each of the problems identified during the first three stages.

**Step 5:** - test [validate solutions] â€” redefine one or more problems and inform the understanding of the users, the conditions of use, how people think, behave, and feel, and empathize.

## Human-Centred Design

**HCD -** is a *mindset* that overlays design thinking to ensure that the products are relevant and beneficialâ€” overall â€” for the people they are intended to serve - focuses on the needs of the users. Starts with the people and ends with the solutions. Emphasizes *who we design for.*

HCD - finds the balance of feasibility, viability, and desirability.

> ðŸ’¡ about cultivating deep empathy with the people, youâ€™re designing with; generating ideas; building a bunch of prototypes; sharing what youâ€™ve made together; and eventually, putting your innovative new solution out in the world. - [here](https://designthinking.ideo.com/faq/whats-the-difference-between-human-centered-design-and-design-thinking#:~:text=What's%20the%20difference%20between%20human,creative%20approach%20to%20problem%20solving.&text=Design%20thinking%20helps%20achieve%20that,needs%20and%20desires%20of%20people)

### Stages of HCD

- Understanding opportunity area, organization capability and feasibility
- Meeting people where they are

STEPS

- Observation
- Ideation
- Rapid Prototyping
- User Feedback
- Iteration
- Implementation

**Step 1: OBSERVATION [Inspiration Phase]**

- Be clear on who will be using the product and how
- **Research -** to observe the end-user, learning, and being open to creative possibilities. - understanding who the design is for
- Identify patterns of behaviour, pain points, and places. Try ethnography and putting yourself through the experience your users use.
- Some steps here - **market research [competitor analysis]**

**Step 2: IDEATION**

- Start **brainstorming ideas** with your team based on what you learned from your observations and experiences
- Come up with as many ideas as you can focus on the needs of the people you are designing for.

**Step 3: Rapid Prototyping**

- Quickly build a simple prototype of your idea, it enables you to test with your end-user
- Question - what is the minimum [loveable] product I can build to get user feedback quickly?

**Step 4: User Feedback**

- Get your prototype into the hands of users you are building for

**Step 5: Iteration**

- Keep iterating, testing, and integrating user feedback until your solution is fine-tuned

**Step 6: Implementation**

- develop and get your idea to the world

> ðŸ’¡ Put yourself in your users' shoes, understand what their experiences are, how they feel and how you can improve them. Use information gathered from research to fuel design solutions.
