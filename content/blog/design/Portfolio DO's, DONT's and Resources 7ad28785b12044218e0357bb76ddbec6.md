When was the last time you opened your Twitter Bookmarks?

I would say never, but today a friend asked me a question on portfolios and I had to go back to this thread: ⏭️ [Twitter](https://twitter.com/web_dev_dan/status/1412768826014400512?s=20)

Yeah, Go ahead and read it. I'll be summarizing some of the outstanding responses here though, but read through them.


## Portfolio dos and don'ts from a Twitter thread 😄

- Do invest in a good domain name
- Do Keep the design simple. - people seek two things from your portfolio: what you do and who you are.
- If you want traffic then focus on good, consistent content, making that content easy to read and SEO factors like performance, keywords, etc
- Do focus on having 4-6 projects you can highlight from your site. Things you can link to, and also link to the source code. If you can write a case study about them, even better. Focus on a few quality projects, rather than many so-so ones :)
- Do keep it simple and sweet. Use your own domain, and if you really want to show some skills, code it yourself. But if you can't meet the quality of some free ones, then just use a template, but maybe host it yourself!
- Do Start small, it will get bigger. → [https://t.co/ZII7Tstkrc?amp=1](https://t.co/ZII7Tstkrc?amp=1)
    - A lot of people have already stated it, but I 100% agree on not spending too much time on it. Most people won't notice the little details that we can sometimes obsess over as web devs.
- if you say you can make cool transitions + do all these amazing things... then just show them.
- Less is more: avoid clutter. Try to have at least one hook/CTA above the fold on your landing page. Use animations to get (& keep) attention
- Don't try to learn it all in a day... Make your profile website with the knowledge you have now.. and then as you learn new styles, frameworks, and technologies slowly upgrade your profile website to fit what you have already learned.
- Make sure your actual portfolio section is easy to find. Have links to your projects GitHub as well as their working links. A well explained read me section on your GitHub helps too. That’s where you can explain a lot and highlight your work
- Get something very basic and minimal going that you can build on. Don't get stuck in the weeds of making everything perfect because then you'll never release it.
- Make it HTTPS. Modern browsers would bug visitors about it being not secure.

> 💡 Key Take-Aways: keep it simple, start small and make it easy to find. Also, have one common CTA.
