## Social Media and Branding

Trying to build a specific tone, character, and image of yourself online might be very tiring and in the end, you might lose yourself. However, having a mission and values to guide you to become a better version of yourself, both online and offline is essential. 

> ðŸ’¡ One of the best ways to build your brand is by going the extra mile in whatever you do. Show up and do better than you do your best.

While keeping ensuring your brand is on point, the starting point is your about. How do you describe yourself? What **keywords** should you include? First, before updating your profile: look for some job descriptions that match your skills. Search how recruiters describe the job that you want. From there, match your profile to the same.

Here is how you can curate your brand:
