    - **Application Questions:** 
    This is the most important section of the whole application. You are required to make one video and write two written samples to demonstrate your passion and desire to join the program. The three questions are on: **Inspire, Teach** and **Promote.** 
    The good news is you chose how to answer the questions, whether through video or written. Therefore, the first step is to choose which question you would like to answer using a video.
        
        ![Untitled](img/Untitled%205.png)
        
        Once you have selected the video you would like to submit, go ahead, and record your video. You can upload it to YouTube or OneDrive and submit the link to the video.
        
        Next, fill in the written samples.

        **Tips:** 
        
        - Demonstrate passion in your answers. For instance, when responding to Inspire (how have you acted as an agent of change?), give examples of some activities you have previously been involved in.
        - Make sure your answers are honest and ensure to include your achievements or projects you are working on.
    - **Social Media:** add links to your social media profiles. The links will be used in your student ambassador profile if your application is accepted.
    - **Additional Information:** do you have any other additional information you would like to share with the selection team? This is the right place to input them, including technologies you are passionate about.
- Once you are done, click submit to finish your application. Remember, if you can come back and edit your application until it is in review phase.

### **Before you go:**

First, if you get a rejection, you can reapply to the program. Do not let rejection put you down. Secondly, have you worked together with a student ambassador? You can reach out to them and ask them for a nomination!
