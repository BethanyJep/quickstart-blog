For a while in 2019, I was unsure of whether or not I was actually good in Azure. I wanted to prove to myself that I understood the concepts and I was good enough to teach them to other students. Therefore, the next logical step I knew was to get Azure Fundamentals Certification (AZ-900).

A physical proof of my knowledge. However, I was scared and it was not until July 2020 that I did and passed my first exam. Five Azure certifications later, and am confident in my skills.

## Certification Benefits and Paths

Other than gaining confidence in your skills, certifications open you up to a lot of benefits. For instance, you can land a new job, get a promotion or even attract more clients. Microsoft certification offers numerous opportunities, not just developers. Under the certification, you can upskill in different paths, for instance: as a Data Scientist, DevOps Engineer, Security Engineer, Solution Architect, Developer, Data Engineer, Functional Consultant, and an Administrator.

## First things first: get a voucher

Microsoft Certifications are relatively affordable and prices range depending on your location.

If you are not able to pay for a certification, don’t worry, there are many opportunities to obtain one. As a [Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador](https://aka.ms/studentambassadors), I was able to get a free Microsoft Learn voucher, 2 actually as the program transitioned from being Microsoft Student Partners. This is just one way of obtaining a certification voucher. Other ways you can obtain a free voucher include:

- Attending major Microsoft events such as Build and Ignite which create [Cloud Skills Challenges](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/microsoft-ignite-free-certification-exam-offer-nov-2021). On completing some learning modules, you get specific exam vouchers.
- Look out for training programs such as Andela Learning Community and [Cert Matters](https://uk.bettshow.com/Microsoft-Hub) which offer free exam vouchers to learners.

# The A-Z of AZ-900

When starting out with Microsoft Certifications, it is advised to start with the fundamentals. What a better way to start than with AZ-900? As you prepare to get certified, the best place you can start is the [Microsoft Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/az-900) documentation. The learning path contains different modules that will help you grasp the basics of Azure, a certification checklist and finally, practice questions to test your knowledge. It is definitely a one stop shop for everything AZ-900. Additionally, you can pay for [instructor-led](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/courses/az-900t01) sessions, or opt for other learning platforms such as Udemy, Pluralsight or Coursera.

For my first certification, I was able to attend a 3-day training session by [LGIT](https://www.lgit.co.za/azure) beforehand which enabled me to be well equipped for the exam. However, in my subsequent certifications, I self studied for them. One of the tips I can give is to learn your learning style. Myself, I learn better when I write down notes and revise them as the exam date approaches. Furthermore, I also do practice questions to test my knowledge and know which areas I need to improve on.

> 💡 Caution: avoid exam dumps as it is illegal and can lead to disqualification.

As I scheduled my exam, I set aside one hour each day to read the exam and do practice labs to ensure I was ready and prepared to take on the exam.
