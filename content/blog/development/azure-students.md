In the session, I covered:
* Getting started with a free [Azure for Students Account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/students/)
* Next we deployed a simple Hello World Flask application using Azure Web Services
* Lastly we covered how you can add your teammates to your directory

## Questions

I got some amazing questions, which needed additional follow up resources, here they are: 


> **Question 1: how do you allocate a domain name to the app you deploy on the Azure portal service?** 

* [Tutorial: Map an existing custom DNS name to Azure App Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/app-service-web-tutorial-custom-domain?tabs=a%2Cazurecli)
* [Custom domains with Azure Static Web Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/custom-domain)

> **Question 2: Does Azure allow deploying of frontend apps such as vue.js**
 

* [Quickstart: Building your first static site with Azure Static Web Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/getting-started?tabs=vue)
